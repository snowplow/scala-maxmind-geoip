# Scala MaxMind IP Lookups [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snowplow/scala-maxmind-iplookups.png)](https://travis-ci.org/snowplow/scala-maxmind-iplookups)

## Introduction

This is a Scala wrapper for the MaxMind [Java Geo-IP] [java-lib] library. 
The main benefits of using this wrapper over directly calling the Java library from Scala are:

1. **Provides a common interface to four MaxMind databases** - it works with MaxMind's databases for looking up geographic location, ISP, organization, and domain from an IP address
2. **Easier to setup/test** - the SBT project definition makes it easy to download and test
3. **Better type safety** - the MaxMind Java library is somewhat null-happy. This wrapper uses Option boxing wherever possible
4. **Better performance** - as well as or instead of using MaxMind's own caching (`GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE`), you can also configure an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache of variable size

## Installation

The latest version of scala-maxmind-iplookups is **0.4.0** and is compatible with all Scala versions from 2.11 onwards.

Add this to your SBT config:

```scala
// Resolvers
val snowplowRepo = "SnowPlow Repo" at "http://maven.snplow.com/releases/"

// Dependency
val maxmindIpLookups = "com.snowplowanalytics"  %% "scala-maxmind-iplookups"  % "0.4.0"
```

Note the double percent (`%%`) between the group and artifactId. 
That'll ensure you get the right package for your Scala version.

Retrieve the `GeoLiteCity.dat` file from the [MaxMind downloads page] [maxmind-downloads] ([direct link] [geolitecity-dat]).

MaxMind also has databases for looking up [ISPs][maxmind-isp], [organizations][maxmind-org], and [domain names][maxmind-domain] from IP addresses. Scala MaxMind IP Lookups supports all of these.

## Usage

Here is a simple usage example, performing just a geographic lookup and not the ISP, organization, or domain lookups:

```scala
import com.snowplowanalytics.maxmind.IpLookups

val ipLookups = IpLookups(
  geoFile = Some("/opt/maxmind/GeoLiteCity.dat"), 
  ispFile = None,
  orgFile = None, 
  domainFile = None, 
  memCache = false, 
  lruCache = 20000
)

ipLookups
  .performLookups("213.52.50.8")
  .maybeIpLocation
  .foreach { loc =>
    println(loc.countryCode)   // => "NO"
    println(loc.countryName)   // => "Norway" 
  }
```

Note that `GeoLiteCity.dat` is updated by MaxMind each month - see [maxmind-geolite-update] [maxmind-geolite-update] 
for a Python script that pings MaxMind regularly to keep your local copy up-to-date.

For further usage examples for Scala MaxMind IP Lookups, please see the tests in [`IpLookupsTest.scala`] [iplookupstest-scala]. 
The test suite uses test databases provided by MaxMind.

## Implementation details

### IpLookups constructor

The signature is as follows:

```scala
class IpLookups(
  geoFile: Option(File), 
  ispFile: Option(File), 
  orgFile: Option(File), 
  domainFile: Option(File), 
  memCache: Boolean = true, 
  lruCache: Int = 10000
)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext)
```

In the `IpLookups` companion object there is an alternative constructor which takes Option[String] as the time of the file arguments instead:

```scala
def apply(
  geoFile: Option[String] = None,
  ispFile: Option[String] = None,
  orgFile: Option[String] = None,
  domainFile: Option[String] = None,
  netSpeedFile: Option[String] = None,
  memCache: Boolean = true,
  lruCache: Int = 10000
)(implicit executionContext: ExecutionContext): IpLookups
```

The first four arguments are the MaxMind databases from which the lookup should be performed. 
`geoFile`, `ispFile`, `orgFile`, and `domainFile` refer respectively to MaxMind's databases for looking up 
location, ISP, organization, and domain based on an IP address. 
They are all wrapped in `Option`, so if you don't have access to all of them, just pass in `None` as in the example above. 
The ones you do pass in must be wrapped in `Some`.

In both signatures, the `memCache` flag is set to `true` by default. This flag enables MaxMind's own caching (`GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE`).

The `lruCache` value defaults to `10000` - meaning Scala MaxMind IP Lookups will maintain an LRU cache of 10,000 values, 
which it will check prior to making a MaxMind lookup. To disable the LRU cache, set its size to zero, i.e. `lruCache = 0`.

### Returned value
The `performLookups(ip)` method returns an `IpLookupResult`. 
The first element is the result of the geographic location lookup. 
It is either `None` (if no geographic lookup database was provided or if the lookup returned `null`) or `Some(ipLocation)`, 
where `ipLocation` is an instance of the `IpLocation` case class described below. 
The other three elements in the tuple are `Option`s wrapping the results of the other three possible lookups: ISP, organization, and domain.

### IpLocation case class
The geographic lookup returns an `IpLocation` case class instance with the following structure:

```scala
case class IpLocation(
  countryCode: String,
  countryName: String,
  region: Option[String],
  city: Option[String],
  latitude: Float,
  longitude: Float,
  timezone: Option[String],
  postalCode: Option[String],
  dmaCode: Option[Int],
  areaCode: Option[Int],
  metroCode: Option[Int],
  regionName: Option[String]  
)
```

### An example using multiple databases

This example shows how to do a lookup using all four databases.

```scala
import com.snowplowanalytics.maxmind.IpLookups

val ipLookups = IpLookups(geoFile = Some("/opt/maxmind/GeoLiteCity.dat"),
                  ispFile = Some("/opt/maxmind/GeoIPISP.dat"),
                  orgFile = Some("/opt/maxmind/GeoIPOrg.dat"),
                  domainFile = Some("/opt/maxmind/GeoIPDomain.dat"),
                  memCache = false, lruCache = 20000)

val lookupResult = ipLookups.performLookups("70.46.123.145")

// Geographic lookup
println(lookupResult._1).map(_.countryName) //=> Some("United States")
println(lookupResult._1).map(_.regionName)  // => Some("Florida")

// ISP lookup
println(lookupResult._2) // => Some("FDN Communications")

// Organization lookup
println(lookupResult._3) // => Some("DSLAM WAN Allocation")

// Domain lookup
println(lookupResult._4) // => Some("nuvox.net")
```

### LRU cache

We recommend trying different LRU cache sizes to see what works best for you.

Please note that the LRU cache is **not** thread-safe ([see this note] [twitter-lru-cache]). Switch it off if you are working with threads.

## Building etc

Assuming you already have SBT installed:

    $ git clone git://github.com/snowplow/scala-maxmind-iplookups.git
    $ cd scala-maxmind-iplookups
    $ sbt test
    <snip>
    [info] Passed: : Total 276, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 276, Skipped 0

## Roadmap

Nothing planned currently, although we want to look into Specs2's data tables and see if they would be a better fit for the unit tests.
